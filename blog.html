                        We have visited a lot of countries here in Europe.<br>
                        This year i was with my friend in Malta. A small island with a lot to offer.<br>
                        We went almost in October, but the weather as you can witness these days, was great. The sea water was very warm and nice.
                        <br>In my opinion the best this island has to offer is the Comino Island. That's an island inside this island. :)

                        The structure of the cities is unique. There is one place named Mdina.<br>
                        This city has one place like a castle and it's probably hundreds years old.<br>It's a tourists place, but fun fact,<br>
                        people are living inside the buildings. 
                        <img src="mdina.jpg" alt="mdina"><br> You can see the parked cars.
